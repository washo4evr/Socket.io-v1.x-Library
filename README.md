# Socket.io-v1.x-Library
Socket.io Library for Arduino

Works with W5100 & ENC28J60 as well as ESP8266

Library will not work when the ESP8266 is being driven by a Uno

Support for JSON was added using https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson
Users will need to download the library directly from this link and install it.

Instead of using client.send, you can now use client.sendJSON
